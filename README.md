# Baseball-Pitch-Simulation
Baseball pitch simulation created on Matlab using a Simulink block model.
Simulink Block Model has inputs: release points (x and y), spin angle, spin rate, and release velocity. All inputs are initialized in the base workspace (livescript included) as Simulink Parameters. This allows the user to change inputs and run simulation directly from the workspace, effectively allowing the user to model multiple pitches using the same block model.
